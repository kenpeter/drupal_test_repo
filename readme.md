# Intro

How to do the following in Drupal 7 or 8? High level description should be enough.

# Question 1
Create an event content type with:
* Date fields for start/end
* Hero image
* Event details
* The option to select 1 of 5 people as the event contact

# Question 2
Create two 'Selected Events' blocks
* One of the most recent 3 events
* One of three author selectable events

# Keys to meet
* Where this will be created
* How this will be pushed to the cloud environment


# Approach
I setup an drupal 8 instance to test it
* Follow this tutorial: https://www.linuxbabe.com/linux-server/drupal-8-ubuntu-16-04-nginx-mariadb-php7
